> ```env
> DB_HOST=mysql
> DB_USERNAME=sail
> DB_PASSWORD=password
> REDIS_HOST=redis
> MAIL_HOST=mailhog
>```


#### Install composer dependencies
```bash
  composer install
```
> **Note**
> If you are using docker (or sail) you can run the following command
> ```bash
>  docker run --rm \
>    -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
>    -v $(pwd):/var/www/html \
>    -w /var/www/html \
>    laravelsail/php81-composer:latest \
>    composer install --ignore-platform-reqs

> sail npm ci
>```

#### Build node assets
```bash
npm run dev
```
> **Note**
